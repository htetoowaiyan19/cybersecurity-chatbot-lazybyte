      <h2 style="color: #4918ea;">Company History - LazyByte</h2>

      <p>
        LazyByte was founded in <strong>2023</strong> with a bold mission:  
        <em>to make digital security smarter, simpler, and more accessible through the power of artificial intelligence.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        What began as a small research initiative between cybersecurity enthusiasts and machine learning experts  
        has grown into a trusted platform for secure user experiences.
      </p>

      <p>
        From our early days building phishing detection tools, LazyByte quickly evolved.  
        By combining <strong>AI</strong>, <strong>real-time threat analysis</strong>, and <strong>legal compliance standards</strong>,  
        we developed an ecosystem that not only defends against cyber threats but also educates users and organizations.
      </p>

      <p>
        In <strong>2024</strong>, we launched our first <strong>AI-powered chatbot</strong>, transforming how individuals interact with cybersecurity.  
        By the end of that year, our tools were integrated by small businesses, educators, and IT teams seeking smarter,  
        user-friendly protection.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Our mission continues:</strong> to protect people through intelligent, ethical, and responsible technology.
