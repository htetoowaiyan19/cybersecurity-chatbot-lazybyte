      <h2>🛡️ What is Cybersecurity?</h2>
      <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. These attacks often target sensitive information or aim to interrupt services. Everyone — from individuals to large businesses — needs it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="user">
      <h2>🐛 What is Malware?</h2>
      <p>Malware stands for malicious software. It includes viruses, worms, spyware, ransomware, and trojans. These programs are designed to cause harm, steal data, or spy on users — often through fake emails or bad websites.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>🕵️‍♂️ What is Phishing?</h2>
      <p>Phishing is when attackers send fake emails or messages pretending to be trusted sources. They trick you into clicking links or sharing personal data. These scams often look real — always be careful before clicking.</p>

      <h2>🔐 What is a Strong Password?</h2>
      <p>A strong password uses a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using your name or “123456.” Make it long and unique — like <code>Gr@p3!Tr33_98</code>. Don’t reuse passwords across sites!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="user">
      <h2>📶 Is Public Wi-Fi Safe?</h2>
      <p>Not always. Hackers can use public Wi-Fi to intercept your data. Avoid logging into sensitive accounts, or use a VPN to encrypt your connection while using open networks in cafés or airports.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="user">
      <h2>🧠 Why Does Cyber Awareness Matter?</h2>
      <p>Most attacks happen because of human mistakes, not technical flaws. Clicking the wrong link or using a weak password can open the door to danger. Awareness is your first line of defense.</p>

      <h2>🛑 Final Reminder</h2>
      <p>
        ✅ Think before you click.<br>
        ✅ Use strong passwords.<br>
        ✅ Keep your software updated.<br>
        ✅ Don’t trust everything online.<br>
        ✅ If it looks suspicious — report it!
      </p>

      <h2>🔄 What is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?</h2>
      <p>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password. After entering your password, you’re asked for a second step — like a code sent to your phone or an app notification. Even if someone steals your password, they can’t log in without that second code. 
        It’s simple, powerful, and protects your accounts better./p>

        <h2>🧬 Why Software Updates Are Important?</h2>
        <p>
            Many people ignore update notifications — but they’re more important than you think. Software updates often patch security vulnerabilities. Hackers scan the internet for unpatched systems. If you delay updates, your device becomes an easy target. 
            Set your apps and system to update automatically to stay safe without thinking about it.

        <h2>🧑‍💻 Safe Browsing Habits</h2>
        <p>
           When online, think before you click. Stick to secure websites (look for "https://"). Avoid downloading unknown files or browser extensions. If a website looks suspicious — leave it. Popups offering prizes or urgent warnings are common scam tactics. 
           Install a reliable browser and use built-in tools to block dangerous sites.

        <h2>📥 How to Spot a Scam Email?</h2>
        <p>
            MScam emails often pretend to be from trusted companies, banks, or even coworkers. Watch for bad grammar, strange links, or urgent language like “act now!” Never click on attachments from unknown sources. 
            If you’re unsure, don’t reply — contact the company directly through their website or app.

        <h2>🛒 Online Shopping Safely</h2>
        <p>
            Online shopping is convenient — but risky if you're not careful. Always shop on known, trusted sites. Use strong passwords and avoid saving card details unless necessary. Use a credit card or secure payment method instead of direct bank transfers. 
            Watch for fake discounts or clone websites that mimic real brands..

        <h2>💳 Protecting Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
            Think of your personal info — name, address, birthday — like digital gold. Don’t overshare online. Even small details can help scammers guess your passwords or reset you
            r accounts. Check your social media privacy settings, and don’t post things like “First pet's name” — they’re often password recovery answers.
