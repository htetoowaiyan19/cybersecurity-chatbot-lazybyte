        <h5 class="text-warning">‚öîÔ∏è Challenge Mode</h5>
        <p>
            Challenge Mode can be played at any time, but only your <strong>first successful submission</strong> for each difficulty per week will count. 
            If you finalize a Challenge, any additional points earned from repeat attempts in the same week will not be rewarded.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you fail a challenge, you can choose to <strong>retry</strong> or <strong>finalize</strong> it. However, once finalized, your result is locked in for that difficulty for the week.
        </p>
        <p>
            Challenge difficulties must be unlocked in sequence. You must complete:
            <ul>
            <li>Normal to unlock Hard</li>
            <li>Hard to unlock Extreme</li>
            <li>Extreme to unlock Dire</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            You can earn up to <strong>2,600 points</strong> per week across all Challenge difficulties. The weekly reset happens every 
            <strong>Monday at 12:00 AM (UTC+6:30)</strong>.

        <h5 class="text-danger">üîÅ Point Decay Mechanism</h5>
        <p>
            To prevent excessive point inflation, all users‚Äô <strong>total points</strong> are automatically reduced by <strong>dividing by 3</strong> every <strong>48 days</strong>.
            This helps maintain a fair leaderboard and long-term challenge progression.
        </p>
